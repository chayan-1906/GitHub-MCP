## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Package

#### 1. Install Claude Desktop:

Download from [https://claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

#### 2. Download the Executable:

**macOS:**
üì¶ [Download macOS Executable](https://github.com/chayan-1906/GitHub-MCP/releases/download/v1.2.0/github)

**Windows:**
üì¶ [Download Windows Executable](https://github.com/chayan-1906/GitHub-MCP/releases/download/v1.2.0/github.exe)

#### 3. Run the Executable:

- **For macOS users**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x github
  ./github
  ```
- **For Windows users**:
  Double-click the file, or run via terminal: `.\github.exe`

**Note**:

1. No need to run the executable repeatedly
2. Do NOT delete the executable after running
3. If you rename, move, or modify the executable, you must run it again (Step 3) to restart it properly

#### 4. üåê Explore Available Tools (Optional)

Visit the homepage to browse all available tools:

- **Homepage**: **http://localhost:20253/**
- See all 44+ GitHub tools with user-friendly descriptions
- Great for understanding what the server can do

#### 5. (Optional) Stop the Server:

You can stop the server if needed (launching Claude will automatically stop the currently running instance/port)

#### 6. Launch Claude Desktop

Start Claude Desktop application

#### 7. Start Asking Tasks:

Claude will now recognize the available tools with descriptions

**Important**: When prompting Claude, include "use available GitHub tools" in your prompts to ensure the LLM utilizes
the GitHub MCP tools instead of defaulting to web search

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### 1. üìÅ Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chayan-1906/GitHub-MCP.git
cd GitHub-MCP
```

#### 2. üì¶ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. üîß Setup Configuration

Configure your credentials in `src/config/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const PORT = 20253
export const DB_NAME = "github";
export const CLIENT_ID = "your_github_client_id"
export const CLIENT_SECRET = "your_github_client_secret"
export const GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL = `http://localhost:${PORT}/github/oauth/callback`
export const MONGODB_URI = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
export const TOKEN_SECRET = "your_token_secret"
```

Replace placeholder values with your actual GitHub OAuth app credentials and MongoDB connection string.

**Generate a secure token secret:**

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### 4. üåê Explore Available Tools

Visit the homepage to see all available tools with user-friendly descriptions:

- **Homepage**: **http://localhost:20253/**

- Perfect for understanding the server's capabilities

#### 5. üîß Switch GitHub Accounts

To authenticate with a different GitHub account or refresh your session:

- Visit: **http://localhost:20253/auth**
- Complete OAuth flow with desired GitHub account

#### 6. üß™ Run the MCP Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or compile and run:
